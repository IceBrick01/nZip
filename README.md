## How to Use

1. **Modify the URL**: To download a doujinshi, simply replace `.net` with `.zip` in the URL. For example, to download the doujinshi at [https://nhentai.net/g/228922](https://nhentai.net/g/228922), you would navigate to [https://nhentai.zip/g/228922](https://nhentai.zip/g/228922).
   
2. **Direct ID Input**: Alternatively, you can enter the doujinshi ID directly on the nZip homepage to generate your zip archive.

3. **Download the Archive**: Once you have entered the URL or ID, click the "Download" button to generate and download the zip archive.

## Running the Project

### Using Docker

Install Docker (if you haven't already) with the following curl or wget:

```bash
curl -o- https://get.docker.com | bash
```
```bash
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com | bash
```

Next, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IceBrick01/nZip.git
cd nZip
```

Clone the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` and configure the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Then, run the following command to run the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Or use the following command to run the container in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to build the Docker image from scratch, edit the `compose.yml` file and change the `image` field to `build`:
```yml
services:
  nzip-server:
    image: nzip
    build: .
    (...)
```
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The nZip service should now be running on port 3000.
